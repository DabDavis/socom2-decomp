 * re-read from memory at every step, as here), but keeps the walking pair BELOW the copies'
 * temporaries (68/64 against 72/76), where every named pair lands above them; MSL's for_each over
 * the const iterators gives the target's order of operations but its parameters' slots too high
 * (14), over the plain iterators a register walk (0xA0). The pair is likely an inlined function's
