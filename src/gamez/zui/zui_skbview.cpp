 * 1 has none of it: the file's name and every name here are ours. Defined in reverse of their image
 * order (-inline deferred).

 * The unit calls zui_skb.cpp's CBmpWithNode constructor and destructor (0x38E620, 0x38E490): SOCOM
 * II's CBmpWithNode is a shared class, not SOCOM 1's file-local one (the linker kept zui_skb.cpp's
 * copies of its inline members for both units) -- writing this unit's row constructor needs the
 * keyboard's classes moved out of zui_skb.cpp's unnamed namespace into a header and their rows
 * renamed.
